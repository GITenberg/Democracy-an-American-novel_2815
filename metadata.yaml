description: "Democracy: An American Novel is a political novel written by Henry Brooks\
  \ Adams and published anonymously in 1880. Only after the writer's death in 1918\
  \ did his publisher reveal Adams's authorship although, upon publication, the novel\
  \ had immediately become popular. Contemporaneous conjecture placed the book under\
  \ the joint authorship of Clarence King, John Hay and Henry Adams and their spouses\
  \ who lived side by side on H street in Washington, D.C. and were collectively sometimes\
  \ called \"the Five of Hearts.\"\nIn January 2005, the Washington National Opera\
  \ premiered Democracy: An American Comedy, an opera by Scott Wheeler and Romulus\
  \ Linney based upon Henry Adams' book.\nDemocracy is a novel about political power,\
  \ its acquisition, use and abuse. It is set at the beginning of a new administration,\
  \ with the election campaign just over and the new President of the United States\
  \ just having been elected. However, all the characters depicted are entirely fictitious.\
  \ The new president's Christian name is Jacob, while his full name is never revealed.\
  \ In a 1961 foreword to the novel, Henry D. Aiken states that the U.S. president\
  \ of the novel \"bears some resemblance to Andrew Johnson, to Garfield, and to Grant\"\
  . Dates are never mentioned either, but internal evidence (at one point a 25-year-old\
  \ woman says that she was \"almost an infant\" during the Civil War) suggests it\
  \ is set in the late 1870s.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
